# Nginx Unit Homebrew Tap

This is a Homebrew tap for Nginx Unit experimentation. You probably shouldn't use it.

The formula is copied pretty much wholesale from Samuel Cochran's [sj26/homebrew-core](https://github.com/sj26/homebrew-core) repo. I just made a
tap out of it so I could install it without forking all of homebrew-core.
